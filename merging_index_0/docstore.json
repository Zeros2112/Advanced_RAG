Good morning. Welcome to CS229, the machine \nlearning class. So what I wanna do today is ju st spend a little time going over the logistics \nof the class, and then we'll start to  talk a bit about machine learning.  \nBy way of introduction, my name's  Andrew Ng and I'll be instru ctor for this class. And so \nI personally work in machine learning, and I' ve worked on it for about 15 years now, and \nI actually think that machine learning is th e most exciting field of all the computer \nsciences. So I'm actually always excited about  teaching this class. Sometimes I actually \nthink that machine learning is not only the most exciting thin g in computer science, but \nthe most exciting thing in all of human e ndeavor, so maybe a little bias there.  \nI also want to introduce the TAs, who are all graduate students doing research in or \nrelated to the machine learni ng and all aspects of machin e learning. Paul Baumstarck \nworks in machine learning and computer vision.  Catie Chang is actually a neuroscientist \nwho applies machine learning algorithms to try to understand the human brain. Tom Do \nis another PhD student, works in computa tional biology and in sort of the basic \nfundamentals of human learning. Zico Kolter is  the head TA \u2014 he's head TA two years \nin a row now \u2014 works in machine learning a nd applies them to a bunch of robots. And \nDaniel Ramage is \u2014 I guess he's not here  \u2014 Daniel applies l earning algorithms to \nproblems in natural language processing.  \nSo you'll get to know the TAs and me much be tter throughout this quarter, but just from \nthe sorts of things the TA's do, I hope you can  already tell that machine learning is a \nhighly interdisciplinary topic in which just the TAs find l earning algorithms to problems \nin computer vision and biology and robots a nd language. And machine learning is one of \nthose things that has and is having a large impact on many applications.  \nSo just in my own daily work, I actually frequently end up talking to people like \nhelicopter pilots to biologists to people in  computer systems or databases to economists \nand sort of also an unending stream of  people from industry coming to Stanford \ninterested in applying machine learni ng methods to their own problems.  \nSo yeah, this is fun. A couple of weeks ago, a student actually forwar ded to me an article \nin \"Computer World\" about the 12 IT skills th at employers can't say no to.

So I think this is a good time to be \nlearning this stuff and learning algorithms and having a large impact on many segments \nof science and industry.  \nI'm actually curious about something. Learni ng algorithms is one of the things that \ntouches many areas of science and industrie s, and I'm just kind of curious.

So \nevery time you write a check, there's anot her learning algorithm that you're probably \nusing without even being aware of it.  \nIf you use a credit card, or I know at least one phone compan y was doing this, and lots of \ncompanies like eBay as well that do electr onic transactions, there's a good chance that \nthere's a learning algorithm in the backgr ound trying to figure out if, say, your credit \ncard's been stolen or if someone's engaging in a fraudulent transaction.  \nIf you use a website like Amazon or Netflix that will often recommend books for you to \nbuy or movies for you to rent or whatever , these are other examples of learning \nalgorithms that have learned what sorts of th ings you like to buy or what sorts of movies \nyou like to watch and can therefore give  customized recommendations to you.  \nJust about a week ago, I had my car serviced, and even there, my car mechanic was trying \nto explain to me some learning algorithm in th e innards of my car th at's sort of doing its \nbest to optimize my driving performan ce for fuel efficiency or something.  \nSo, see, most of us use learning algorithms half a dozen, a dozen, maybe dozens of times \nwithout even knowing it.  \nAnd of course, learning algorithms are also  doing things like giving us a growing \nunderstanding of the human genome. So if so meday we ever find a cure for cancer, I bet \nlearning algorithms will have had a large role in that. That's sort of the thing that Tom \nworks on, yes?  \nSo in teaching this class, I sort of have thre e goals. One of them is just to I hope convey \nsome of my own excitement a bout machine learning to you.  \nThe second goal is by the end of this class, I hope all of you will be ab le to apply state-of-\nthe-art machine learning algorithms to whatev er problems you're interested in. And if you \never need to build a system for reading zi p codes, you'll know how to do that by the end \nof this class.  \nAnd lastly, by the end of this class, I reali ze that only a subset of  you are interested in \ndoing research in machine learning, but by the c onclusion of this class,  I hope that all of \nyou will actually be well qualified to star t doing research in machine learning, okay?  \nSo let's say a few words about logistics.

So \nevery time you write a check, there's anot her learning algorithm that you're probably \nusing without even being aware of it.  \nIf you use a credit card, or I know at least one phone compan y was doing this, and lots of \ncompanies like eBay as well that do electr onic transactions, there's a good chance that \nthere's a learning algorithm in the backgr ound trying to figure out if, say, your credit \ncard's been stolen or if someone's engaging in a fraudulent transaction.  \nIf you use a website like Amazon or Netflix that will often recommend books for you to \nbuy or movies for you to rent or whatever , these are other examples of learning \nalgorithms that have learned what sorts of th ings you like to buy or what sorts of movies \nyou like to watch and can therefore give  customized recommendations to you.  \nJust about a week ago, I had my car serviced, and even there, my car mechanic was trying \nto explain to me some learning algorithm in th e innards of my car th at's sort of doing its \nbest to optimize my driving performan ce for fuel efficiency or something.  \nSo, see, most of us use learning algorithms half a dozen, a dozen, maybe dozens of times \nwithout even knowing it.  \nAnd of course, learning algorithms are also  doing things like giving us a growing \nunderstanding of the human genome. So if so meday we ever find a cure for cancer, I bet \nlearning algorithms will have had a large role in that.

And so this year, Stanford is actually starting a small pilot program in which we'll \npost videos of a small number of classes onlin e, so on the Internet in a way that makes it \npublicly accessible to everyone. I'm very exc ited about that because machine learning in \nschool, let's get the word out there.  \nOne of the consequences of this is that \u2014 let's see \u2014 so videos  or pictures of the students \nin this classroom will not be posted online, so your images \u2014 so don't worry about being \nby seeing your own face appear on YouTube one day. But the microphones may pick up your voices, so I guess the consequence of that is that because microphones may pick up your voices, no matter how irritated you are at  me, don't yell out swear words in the \nmiddle of class, but because there won't be video you can safely sit there and make faces \nat me, and that won't show, okay?  \nLet's see. I also handed out this \u2014 ther e were two handouts I hope most of you have, \ncourse information handout. So let me just sa y a few words about parts of these. On the \nthird page, there's a section that says Online Resources.  \nOh, okay. Louder? Actually, could you turn up the volume? Testing. Is this better? \nTesting, testing. Okay, cool.

Ther e was a few projects on improving learning \nalgorithms. There's a project on flying autonomous  aircraft. There was a project actually \ndone by our TA Paul on improvi ng computer vision algorithms  using machine learning.  \nThere are a couple of project s on Netflix rankings using learning algorithms; a few \nmedical robots; ones on segmenting [inaudibl e] to segmenting pieces of the body using \nlearning algorithms; one on musical instrume nt detection; anot her on irony sequence \nalignment; and a few algorithms on understandin g the brain neuroscience, actually quite a \nfew projects on neuroscience; a couple of projects on unde scending fMRI data on brain \nscans, and so on; another project on market makings, the financial trading. There was an \ninteresting project on trying to use learning algorithms to decide what is it that makes a \nperson's face physically attractive. There's a learning algorithm on op tical illusions, and \nso on.  \nAnd it goes on, so lots of fun projects. A nd take a look, then come up with your own \nideas. But whatever you find cool and interest ing, I hope you'll be able to make machine \nlearning a project out of it. Yeah, question?  \nStudent : Are these gro up projects?  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng): Oh, yes, thank you.  \nStudent : So how many people can be in a group?  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng): Right. So projects can be done in  groups of up to three people. \nSo as part of forming study groups, later t oday as you get to know your classmates, I \ndefinitely also encourage you to grab two ot her people and form a group of up to three \npeople for your project, okay? And just start brainstorming ideas for now amongst \nyourselves. You can also come and talk to me or the TAs if you want to brainstorm ideas \nwith us.  \nOkay. So one more organizational ques tion. I'm curious, how many of you know \nMATLAB? Wow, cool, quite a lot. Okay. So as part of the \u2014 act ually how many of you \nknow Octave or have used Octave ?

And so I'm holding the li st in my hand. You can  go home later and \ntake a look at it online.  \nBut reading down this list, I see that last year, there were st udents that ap plied learning \nalgorithms to control a snake robot. Ther e was a few projects on improving learning \nalgorithms. There's a project on flying autonomous  aircraft. There was a project actually \ndone by our TA Paul on improvi ng computer vision algorithms  using machine learning.  \nThere are a couple of project s on Netflix rankings using learning algorithms; a few \nmedical robots; ones on segmenting [inaudibl e] to segmenting pieces of the body using \nlearning algorithms; one on musical instrume nt detection; anot her on irony sequence \nalignment; and a few algorithms on understandin g the brain neuroscience, actually quite a \nfew projects on neuroscience; a couple of projects on unde scending fMRI data on brain \nscans, and so on; another project on market makings, the financial trading. There was an \ninteresting project on trying to use learning algorithms to decide what is it that makes a \nperson's face physically attractive. There's a learning algorithm on op tical illusions, and \nso on.  \nAnd it goes on, so lots of fun projects. A nd take a look, then come up with your own \nideas. But whatever you find cool and interest ing, I hope you'll be able to make machine \nlearning a project out of it. Yeah, question?  \nStudent : Are these gro up projects?  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng): Oh, yes, thank you.  \nStudent : So how many people can be in a group?  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng): Right.

For the next two or th ree weeks, we'll use the discussion sections \nto go over the prerequisites to this class or if some of you haven't seen probability or \nstatistics for a while or maybe algebra, we'll go over those in the discussion sections as a \nrefresher for those of you that want one.  \nLater in this quarter, we'll also use the disc ussion sections to go over extensions for the \nmaterial that I'm teaching in the main lectur es.

That's probably \nthe most common project. Some students will try to improve state-of-the-art machine \nlearning. Some of those projects are also very  successful. It's a littl e bit harder to do. And \nthere's also a smaller minority of students th at will sometimes try to prove \u2014 develop the \ntheory of machine learning further or try to  prove theorems about machine learning. So \nthey're usually great projects of all of those types with applications and machine learning \nbeing the most common. Anything else? Okay, cool.  \nSo that was it for logistics. Let's talk about  learning algorithms. So can I have the laptop \ndisplay, please, or the projector? Actually, co uld you lower the big sc reen? Cool. This is \namazing customer service. Thank you. I see. Okay, cool. Okay. No, that's fine. I see. \nOkay. That's cool. Thanks. Okay.  \nBig screen isn't working toda y, but I hope you can read things  on the smaller screens out \nthere. Actually, [inaudible] I think this room just got a new projector that \u2014 someone \nsent you an excited email \u2014 was it just on Frid ay? \u2014 saying we just got a new projector \nand they said 4,000-to-1 something or othe r brightness ratio. I don't know. Someone was \nvery excited about the new projector in this room, but I guess we'll see that in operation \non Wednesday.  \nSo start by talking about what machine learni ng is. What is machine learning? Actually, \ncan you read the text out there? Raise your hand if the text on the small screens is legible. \nOh, okay, cool, mostly legible. Okay. So I'll just read it out.  \nSo what is machine learning? Way back in  about 1959, Arthur Samuel defined machine \nlearning informally as the [inaudible] that gives computers to learn \u2014 [inaudible] that \ngives computers the ability to learn without  being explicitly programmed.

And \nthere's also a smaller minority of students th at will sometimes try to prove \u2014 develop the \ntheory of machine learning further or try to  prove theorems about machine learning.

So what you can do \nis let's say plot the square footage of the house against the list price of  the house, right, so \nyou collect data on a bunch of houses. And let' s say you get a data set like this with \nhouses of different sizes that are li sted for different amounts of money.  \nNow, let's say that I'm trying to sell a hous e in the same area as Portland, Oregon as \nwhere the data comes from. Let's say I have a hou se that's this size in square footage, and \nI want an algorithm to tell me about how much should I expect my house to sell for. So there are lots of ways to do this, and some of you may have seen elements of what I'm \nabout to say before.  \nSo one thing you could do is look at this data and maybe put a straight  line to it. And then \nif this is my house, you may then look at th e straight line and predict that my house is \ngonna go for about that much money, right? Ther e are other decisions that we can make, \nwhich we'll talk about later, which is, well, what if I don' t wanna put a straight line? \nMaybe I should put a quadratic function to it.

When can  you prove a theorem guaranteeing that a \nlearning algorithm will be at least 99.9 per cent accurate on reading zip codes? This is \nactually somewhat surprising. We actually prove theorems showing when you can expect \nthat to hold.  \nWe'll also sort of delve into learning theo ry to try to understand what algorithms can \napproximate different functions well and also  try to understand things like how much \ntraining data do you need? So how many exampl es of houses do I need in order for your \nlearning algorithm to recognize the pattern be tween the square footage of a house and its \nhousing price? And this will help  us answer questions like if you're trying to design a \nlearning algorithm, should you be spending more time collecting more data or is it a case \nthat you already have enough data; it would be  a waste of time to try to collect more. \nOkay?  \nSo I think learning algorithms are a very powerful tool that  as I walk around sort of \nindustry in Silicon Valley or as I work with  various businesses in CS and outside CS, I \nfind that there's often a huge differen ce between how well so meone who really \nunderstands this stuff can appl y a learning algorithm versus so meone who sort of gets it \nbut sort of doesn't.  \nThe analogy I like to think of  is imagine you were going to a carpentry school instead of \na machine learning class, right? If you go to a carpentry school, they can give you the \ntools of carpentry. They'll give you a hamme r, a bunch of nails, a screwdriver or \nwhatever. But a master carpenter will be able to  use those tools far better than most of us \nin this room. I know a carpen ter can do things with a hammer and nail that I couldn't \npossibly. And it's actually a littl e bit like that in machine learning, too. One thing that's \nsadly not taught in many courses on machine l earning is how to take the tools of machine \nlearning and really, really apply them well.  \nSo in the same way, so the tools of machin e learning are I wanna say quite a bit more \nadvanced than the tools of carpentry.

When can  you prove a theorem guaranteeing that a \nlearning algorithm will be at least 99.9 per cent accurate on reading zip codes? This is \nactually somewhat surprising. We actually prove theorems showing when you can expect \nthat to hold.  \nWe'll also sort of delve into learning theo ry to try to understand what algorithms can \napproximate different functions well and also  try to understand things like how much \ntraining data do you need? So how many exampl es of houses do I need in order for your \nlearning algorithm to recognize the pattern be tween the square footage of a house and its \nhousing price? And this will help  us answer questions like if you're trying to design a \nlearning algorithm, should you be spending more time collecting more data or is it a case \nthat you already have enough data; it would be  a waste of time to try to collect more. \nOkay?  \nSo I think learning algorithms are a very powerful tool that  as I walk around sort of \nindustry in Silicon Valley or as I work with  various businesses in CS and outside CS, I \nfind that there's often a huge differen ce between how well so meone who really \nunderstands this stuff can appl y a learning algorithm versus so meone who sort of gets it \nbut sort of doesn't.  \nThe analogy I like to think of  is imagine you were going to a carpentry school instead of \na machine learning class, right? If you go to a carpentry school, they can give you the \ntools of carpentry. They'll give you a hamme r, a bunch of nails, a screwdriver or \nwhatever.

After lear ning theory, there's a nother class of learning \nalgorithms that I then want to teach you a bout, and that's unsupervised learning.

The data tells you this \npatient has a malignant tumor;  this patient has a benign tumor.

I'm just gonna give you a data set and I'm gonna say, \"Would you please find interesting structure in this data set?\" So that's the unsupervised \nlearning problem where you're sort of not given the right answer for everything.  \nSo, for example, an algorithm may find structure in the data in the form of the data being \npartitioned into two clusters, or clustering is  sort of one example of an unsupervised \nlearning problem.  \nSo I hope you can see this. It turns out that th ese sort of unsupervised  learning algorithms \nare also used in many problems. This is a scr een shot \u2014 this is a picture I got from Sue \nEmvee, who's a PhD student here, who is a pplying unsupervised learning algorithms to \ntry to understand gene data, so is trying to  look at genes as individuals and group them \ninto clusters based on properties of what ge nes they respond to \u2014 based on properties of \nhow the genes respond to different experiments.  \nAnother interesting application of [inaudible] sorts of clus tering algorithms is actually \nimage processing, this which I got from Steve Gules, who's another PhD student. It turns \nout what you can do is if you give this sort of  data, say an image, to certain unsupervised \nlearning algorithms, they will then learn to group pixels together and say, gee, this sort of \npixel seems to belong together , and that sort of pixel seems to belong together.  \nAnd so the images you see on the bottom \u2014 I guess you can just barely see them on there \n\u2014 so the images you see on the bottom are groupings \u2014 are what the algorithm has done \nto group certain pixels together. On a small di splay, it might be easier to just look at the \nimage on the right. The two images on the botto m are two sort of identical visualizations \nof the same grouping of the pixe ls into [inaudible] regions.  \nAnd so it turns out that this sort of clustering algorithm or this sort of unsupervised \nlearning algorithm, which learns  to group pixels together, it turns out to be useful for \nmany applications in vision, in co mputer vision image processing.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3289, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77bdd5bf-980f-4a20-aa84-dab59b4dd04e": {"__data__": {"id_": "77bdd5bf-980f-4a20-aa84-dab59b4dd04e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\giahy\\Desktop\\Advanced_RAG\\auto_merging\\MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 64553, "creation_date": "2023-12-17", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-17", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f5ec080d-a018-4b53-80e3-640ef56511b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\giahy\\Desktop\\Advanced_RAG\\auto_merging\\MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 64553, "creation_date": "2023-12-17", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-17", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-17"}, "hash": "129da09dae45d3b9d16092e81f73c6952492d7fa4517ba8cc54f9a6cd52c7aad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "374d31b9-2ad3-44fb-ba2a-96140a9d6e47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ea49cc5e70262afc71654fd690702e84dfee3930586929a43cfa7ae0faa44dfe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "f5ec080d-a018-4b53-80e3-640ef56511b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\giahy\\Desktop\\Advanced_RAG\\auto_merging\\MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 64553, "creation_date": "2023-12-17", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-17", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-17"}, "hash": "129da09dae45d3b9d16092e81f73c6952492d7fa4517ba8cc54f9a6cd52c7aad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "15f7db3a686f3a940c3a574527db701843b01f837f537035cef09e3fd930f392", "text": "classes teach.

And so becau se the microphones are just at slightly \ndifferent distances to the two people, and th e two people may speak in slightly different \nvolumes, each microphone will pick up an overl apping combination of these two people's", "start_char_idx": 1726, "end_char_idx": 3468, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e296815-b81c-4845-bbde-6c986ae5e942": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e296815-b81c-4845-bbde-6c986ae5e942", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\giahy\\Desktop\\Advanced_RAG\\auto_merging\\MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 64553, "creation_date": "2023-12-17", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-17", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e4067bd0-2433-40fc-b4b6-fe83f78ebb23", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\giahy\\Desktop\\Advanced_RAG\\auto_merging\\MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 64553, "creation_date": "2023-12-17", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-17", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-17"}, "hash": "202c39b96db7989b59f290e9d00cd97fb60ad5d5b87402dd88682f52072d2faa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "5": [{"node_id": "9a0680ed-f574-41e6-a0d2-489307c83e96", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\giahy\\Desktop\\Advanced_RAG\\auto_merging\\MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 64553, "creation_date": "2023-12-17", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-17", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-17"}, "hash": "c009e7a46abe3b15930c492a94bc60aa3d42f6ed3a44fb20f33d27db00c37257", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, {"node_id": "b0e88766-ebdc-4bdb-b471-d755ae08c6ee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\giahy\\Desktop\\Advanced_RAG\\auto_merging\\MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 64553, "creation_date": "2023-12-17", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-17", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-17"}, "hash": "035f1c3ec3c53572fbfaca51a6dab70904400d23c3de3130931c8e6ec5c3dd99", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}]}, "hash": "b9c8053cc1e172e9d0bc3dafacd0bb213d16e958e87e19f4771d678842dc9929", "text": "voices, so slightly different overlapping voice s.

And \nthen it's up to the learning algorithm to  figure out how to maximize the \"good dog\" \nreward signals and minimize the \"bad dog\" punishments.  \nSo it turns out reinforcement learning is applie d to other problems in robotics. It's applied \nto things in web crawling and so on. But it's just  cool to show videos, so let me just show \na bunch of them. This learning algorithm was actually implemented by our head TA, Zico, of programming a four-legged dog. I guess Sam Shriver in this class also worked \non the project and Peter Renfrew and Mike and a few others. But I guess this really is a \ngood dog/bad dog since it's a robot dog.  \nThe second video on the right, some of the st udents, I guess Peter, Zico, Tonca working \non a robotic snake, again using learning algorith ms to teach a snake robot to climb over \nobstacles.  \nBelow that, this is kind of a fun example.  Ashutosh Saxena and Jeff Michaels used \nlearning algorithms to teach a car how to  drive at reasonably high speeds off roads \navoiding obstacles.  \nAnd on the lower right, that's a robot program med by PhD student Eva Roshen to teach a \nsort of somewhat strangely configured robot how to get on top of an obstacle, how to get \nover an obstacle. Sorry. I know the video's kind of small. I hope you can sort of see it. \nOkay?  \nSo I think all of these are robots that I thi nk are very difficult to hand-code a controller \nfor by learning these sorts of l earning algorithms. You can in relatively short order get a \nrobot to do often pretty amazing things.  \nOkay. So that was most of what I wanted to say today. Just a couple more last things, but \nlet me just check what questions you have righ t now. So if there are no questions, I'll just \nclose with two reminders, which are after class today or as you start to talk with other \npeople in this class, I just encourage you again to start to form project partners, to try to \nfind project partners to do your project with.

And \nthen it's up to the learning algorithm to  figure out how to maximize the \"good dog\" \nreward signals and minimize the \"bad dog\" punishments.  \nSo it turns out reinforcement learning is applie d to other problems in robotics. It's applied \nto things in web crawling and so on. But it's just  cool to show videos, so let me just show \na bunch of them. This learning algorithm was actually implemented by our head TA, Zico, of programming a four-legged dog. I guess Sam Shriver in this class also worked \non the project and Peter Renfrew and Mike and a few others. But I guess this really is a \ngood dog/bad dog since it's a robot dog.  \nThe second video on the right, some of the st udents, I guess Peter, Zico, Tonca working \non a robotic snake, again using learning algorith ms to teach a snake robot to climb over \nobstacles.  \nBelow that, this is kind of a fun example.  Ashutosh Saxena and Jeff Michaels used \nlearning algorithms to teach a car how to  drive at reasonably high speeds off roads \navoiding obstacles.  \nAnd on the lower right, that's a robot program med by PhD student Eva Roshen to teach a \nsort of somewhat strangely configured robot how to get on top of an obstacle, how to get \nover an obstacle. Sorry. I know the video's kind of small. I hope you can sort of see it. \nOkay?  \nSo I think all of these are robots that I thi nk are very difficult to hand-code a controller \nfor by learning these sorts of l earning algorithms.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1937, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c0df9ae-3df6-49c1-b085-21047ae259e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c0df9ae-3df6-49c1-b085-21047ae259e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\giahy\\Desktop\\Advanced_RAG\\auto_merging\\MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 64553, "creation_date": "2023-12-17", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-17", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e36b84ef-8381-4534-aed2-7da847c346a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\giahy\\Desktop\\Advanced_RAG\\auto_merging\\MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 64553, "creation_date": "2023-12-17", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-17", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-17"}, "hash": "ee2a71c77549d6f8cd6af7d29b101ccf1c63bdd5c42f0c04bef796e571eeadd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "362fd492-98c4-409f-b781-480f7509a75a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\giahy\\Desktop\\Advanced_RAG\\auto_merging\\MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 64553, "creation_date": "2023-12-17", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-17", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-17"}, "hash": "5c8d238fd837d0e4fe680f72eaa3122518a005831c4d531127694724507e5f15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "4": {"node_id": "e36b84ef-8381-4534-aed2-7da847c346a7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\giahy\\Desktop\\Advanced_RAG\\auto_merging\\MachineLearning-Lecture01.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 64553, "creation_date": "2023-12-17", "last_modified_date": "2023-12-17", "last_accessed_date": "2023-12-17"}, "hash": "ee2a71c77549d6f8cd6af7d29b101ccf1c63bdd5c42f0c04bef796e571eeadd5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a16a800b248b349ab0628f2226b64999d642eda314b0e43bc4745222161fdd5a", "text": "You can in relatively short order get a \nrobot to do often pretty amazing things.  \nOkay.
